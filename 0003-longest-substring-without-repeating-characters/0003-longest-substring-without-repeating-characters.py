# why right-left +1
# For example, if left = 2 and right = 5:

# Characters at indices 2, 3, 4, and 5 are included in your substring
# That's 4 characters total
# And indeed, 5-2+1 = 4

# This is different from calculating a simple difference which would give you 
# (5-2 = 3), missing one character.
# It's similar to calculating how many integers exist between two numbers '
# '(inclusive) - the formula is always end - start + 1.'

# The core logic:

# Use a sliding window with left pointer at start of current valid substring
# Track character positions in a dictionary
# When finding a duplicate character, update left pointer only if the previous 
# occurrence is within current window
# Calculate window length at each step and track maximum

# The key condition for updating left:

# When we find a character we've seen before
# AND its previous position â‰¥ current left
# Then move left to (previous position + 1)

# This approach ensures we always maintain a window with unique characters, 
# efficiently jumping the left pointer forward when needed rather than checking 
# character by character.
